In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this project, I explored a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To complete this project, I implemented several conditional predictions and ensured the predictions accuracy is over 80%.
